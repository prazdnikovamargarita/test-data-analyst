Task 1: SQL queries

There are next tables: users, leads, domains, courses.
Prepare SQL queries to select the next data:
1.1. The number of created leads per week grouped by course type
1.2. The number of WON flex leads per country created from 01.01.2024
1.3. User email, lead id and lost reason for users who have lost flex leads from 01.07.2024

Task 2: Web scraping 
Create a web scraper using Selenium to extract the list of courses from the landing page of the mate.academy website. The scraper should gather the following information for each course:
Course name
Short description
Course type (full-time or flex)

Hints:
Ensure your code adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles
Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to keep your code modular and maintainable
Implement the simplest solution that fulfills the requirements

Optional Task:
Additionally, extract the following details for each course:
Number of Modules
Number of Topics
Course Duration

We are open to questions, so feel free to ask if you need more details.
